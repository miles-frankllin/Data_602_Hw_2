    "# Abstract\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is, in itself, a massive subset of computer science. I used this project as a opportunity to begin to explore that field, while demonstrating how machine learning models play role. The data used in this study was collection of tweets from 16 verified health-focused accounts (BBC Health, CBC Health, etc.). I found this data searching through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), although the original credit belongs to Amir Karami, from the University of South Carolina. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the goal of this project is to detect trends in twitter accounts who's target audience is accounts interested general health."

    "# Motivation\n",
    "Initially, the goal of this project was to perform a very similar analysis on Donald Trump's rally speeches leading up to the 2020 presidential election. The hope was that I would be able to group words together in a meaningful way, such that I would be able to extract topics from his speeches. While I am still working to finalize that project, this accomplishes a similar task, and has better prepared me to revisit that goal."

    "# Representing Words Numerically\n",
    "Before performing any analysis we have to first clean, and convert our data frame from a list of tweets into a numerical format. Below is a handful of tweets from our data frame with some of the other unused columns removed from view. This data frame will serve as our corpus, where each tweet is treated as its own individual document."

In the Calinski Harabasz test in graph three, there was a much more convincing \"elbow\" to choose from.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "K-Means clustering is a powerful tool, and an excellent introduction into the field of unsupervised learning. Paired with a handful of Natural Language Processing libraries, I was able to successfully extract value out of more than 60,000 tweets, and group them in a meaningful way. While there value of the collection of tweets analyzed may be variable from reader to reader, it should be universally understood that the techniques presented are well worth studying, and applying to future data."
